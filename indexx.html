               <p>Hi, My name is  Alejandro Gonzalez. I am mostly interested in playing video games, for example; Splatoon 2, Injustice, Mortal Kombat, and I also love Zelda. I love watching new tv shows on Netflix and making new friends.</p>
               <p>The most important things in my life are my family. My sister recently had a baby and I just can't believe how much love I have for him. I know that I will always protect him and I will always try to be there for him as a good uncle. </p>
               <p>My career aspiration is that someday I would have my own business and I would be able to provide for my parents and siblings.</p>
